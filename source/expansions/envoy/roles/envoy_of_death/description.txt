You are the Envoy Of Death, sent here to destroy this place and clean out all the sinners, killing people one by one.

Every night, you may attack a target with a basic attack. Your abilities will grow as one of the envoys of the Horsemen of the Apocalypse dies.

One dead envoy - You are given one unstoppable attack.
Two dead envoys - You are given a roleblock immunity.
Three dead envoys - Instead of basic attack, you will deal an unstoppable attack towards the target and the people that visit your target.

You may communicate with other envoys every night.

Your goal is to reach the majority with other envoys without any threat to your team.
