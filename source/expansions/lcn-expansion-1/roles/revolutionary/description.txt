You are one to be feared.

Every night, you may tag a bomb on a player. This bomb will come together with an uncommon noun, which you will be made aware of.

If your target says this noun the next day in any of the chats, the bomb will detonate immediately, dealing them an Unstoppable attack.

Your target is not informed that a bomb has been planted on them and the bomb will deactivate the next night if it did not blow up.

Kill 3 people with this method to become the game's sole winner.
