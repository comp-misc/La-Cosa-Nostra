You are the local Town healer, until the Mafia came, and you decided to use your pharmacologic skills to poison them.

On any night, you may poison a player. The poisoned player is notified as such. If they are not cured of the poison by the next night, they will be dealt an Unstoppable attack.

You may poison only twice.
