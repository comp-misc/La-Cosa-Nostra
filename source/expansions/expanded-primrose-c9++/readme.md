### Features:

- Procedurally generated setup with random number rolls.
- The stronger the Town, the stronger the Mafia.
- Caters for 21 players instead of 17 in Primrose C9++

### General remarks:

- Roleblock actions cannot be roleblocked.
- Serial killers are to choose their perks on Day 0 instead of pre-game - failure to do so will result in no perk granted.
- Some role descriptions have been updated.
