Outwardly, everyone knows you as a harmless, polite person. However, you spread disease. And when everyone is weakened by it, you strike.

Every night, you may infect a person with the plague. People who visit you also get infected.

Infected players infect each other on visits. Infected players are not notified that they have been infected.

When everyone alive is infected with the plague, you become Pestilence. This gives you a Powerful attack every night which also kills all visitors on your target. You also gain an Unstoppable defense. However, your detection immunity is nulled when you become Pestilence.
